# MAME Lua API Type Definitions for Lua Language Server
This is an [addon](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/Addons) that can be used by the [Lua Language Server](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server).

It provides type definitions and documentation for the Lua interface implemented by MAME.

# Use
You must be using the [Lua Language Server](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server) in order to use these type definitions effectively. Until they are added to the official [LLS-Addons](https://github.com/LuaLS/LLS-Addons), you may download this repository and then add the `library/` directory to your [LuaLS configuration file](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/Configuration-File)'s [`workspace.library`](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/Settings#workspacelibrary).
